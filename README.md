# FED1 Project Exam 1

Hilde Vatne`s exam

This exam has been challenging to complete. My father’s lung cancer worsened just before I received the exam assignment. He passed away and was buried during the exam period, which has affected both my mental and physical ability to dedicate as much time to the task as I had originally planned.
I am a board member of Kristiansand Swimming Alliance (KSA) and recently became responsible for the club’s website. For this exam, I chose to create a blog for KSA. I had access to some professional photographs, but since the images need to have a public URL to be used via the API, I couldn’t include them in the project (except for the header and footer). I also attempted to use the club’s Instagram photos but suspect they are only accessible to followers. As a result, I used images from KSA’s Facebook page for the blog.
In terms of design, I based the colour scheme on the club’s logo. I replaced the yellow in the logo with gold, as we adopted gold swim caps after the club’s 100th anniversary in 2022. I used the red from the logo only for the "delete" button, but I incorporated the red lane dividers in the footer.
I based the JavaScript on my previous "Rainydays" submission. I used the header from

and adapted it for my use, including moving the JavaScript from the HTML to a separate .mjs file.

I used ChatGPT 4.0 extensively throughout this project, and it provided valuable guidance and discussions. It helped me troubleshoot and identify conflicting elements in my code. I prefer organizing my code by splitting functions into multiple files, as this makes it easier for me to maintain and navigate the codebase.
Responsiveness and Accessibility:
I made the website responsive to ensure it works well on different screen sizes and devices. The blog layout adjusts dynamically, and I considered mobile, tablet, and desktop views during development. I also tested the website for accessibility using WAVE to ensure that it meets WCAG standards. This included checking colour contrast, heading structure, and ensuring that interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation.
Improvements and Future Considerations:
If I had more time or resources, I would have liked to implement a search and filter mechanism to allow users to easily find specific posts. I originally planned to create this functionality, as it would enhance the user experience, especially for a growing blog. After that, I intended to complete the rest of the Level 2 Process.
