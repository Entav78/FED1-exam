# FED1 Project Exam 1

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the FED1 Project Exam at Noroff. The goal was to create a functional and responsive blog platform, and I chose to do this for Kristiansand Swimming Alliance (KSA), where I am a board member and recently became responsible for the club's website. The blog allows for post creation, editing, and deletion, and it is designed to be responsive across different devices.

## Background and Challenges
This exam was particularly challenging for me due to personal circumstances. My father’s lung cancer worsened just before I received the assignment, and he passed away during the exam period. This affected both my mental and physical ability to fully dedicate myself to the task, but I completed the project.

## Design Choices
The design of the blog is based on KSA's official logo. I replaced the yellow in the logo with gold, as the club adopted gold swim caps after its 100th anniversary in 2022. The red from the logo is used for the "delete" button, while the red lane dividers are incorporated into the footer. 

I utilized images from KSA's Facebook page, as the images I had access to from a professional photographer required public URLs, which I couldn’t implement via the API. I also attempted to use the club's Instagram photos, but they appeared to be restricted to followers.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the front-end development
- **Fetch API** for interacting with the blog's post system
- **GitHub** for version control and project management
- **WAVE** for accessibility testing

## Responsiveness and Accessibility
I ensured the website is responsive and adjusts dynamically across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. I also focused on accessibility, testing the project with the WAVE tool to ensure compliance with WCAG standards. This included checking colour contrast, heading structure, and keyboard accessibility.

## JavaScript and Functionality
The JavaScript is heavily inspired by my previous submission, *RainyDays*. I based the header on [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8smiWQ8Seg&t=6s) and adapted it to suit my project needs. I moved the JavaScript into a separate `.mjs` file for better modularity and code organization. 

I used **ChatGPT 4.0** extensively throughout the project for discussions and troubleshooting, which helped me solve various issues, including identifying conflicting elements in the code.

## Improvements and Future Considerations
Given more time or resources, I would have liked to implement a search and filter mechanism to enhance user experience. This feature would allow users to easily find specific blog posts, especially as the blog grows. I also intended to further improve the project's accessibility by completing more Level 2 WCAG standards.

## Installation and Usage
To run this project locally:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
3. The project fetches data via a local API (ensure the API server is running).
